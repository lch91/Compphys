\section*{Project 4}
\subsection*{Abstract}

\subsection*{Introduction}
In this project we will look at the diffusion equation for three different schemes, forward Euler, Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson. The diffusion equation is important in biology as the dominant way of transporting signals between neurons in the brain is by means of diffusion of neurotransmitters across the synaptic cleft separating the cell membranes of the two cells.

The Backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson schemes are implicit and we can use the tridiagonal solver we developed in the first project. The Forward Euler scheme is explicit and we cannot use the tridiagonal solver, so we use the standard way of solving it. You can find the codes I have used for solving this project here: \url{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0513xgz586787ih/tRp9WP5cXC}. 

\subsection*{Methods}
We start the project by finding a closed form solution of the diffusion equation. The diffusion equation look like this:
\[

with initial conditions:
